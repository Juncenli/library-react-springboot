To implement an online book rental website using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, follow these steps:

### Plan the project:
- Identify the features, such as user authentication, book browsing, search, rental, and return functionality.
- Design the database schema, including tables for users, books, and rental transactions.
  
### Set up the development environment:
- Install Node.js and npm (Node package manager) for React development.
- Install Java JDK and Apache Maven for Spring Boot development.
- Choose an IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA.
  
### Create the Spring Boot backend:
- Generate a Spring Boot project using the Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/). Select the required dependencies, such as Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and a database connector (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
- Set up database connection details in the application.properties file.
- Create the necessary entity classes for users, books, and rental transactions.
- Implement repository interfaces using Spring Data JPA for easy database access.
- Develop the service layer to handle business logic.
- Create RESTful API controllers to expose endpoints for frontend consumption.
- Add user authentication and authorization using Spring Security, if needed.
  
### Create the React frontend:
- Use the Create React App tool (npx create-react-app app-name) to generate a new React project.
- Organize the project structure with components, containers, and services.
- Install necessary libraries, such as React Router for navigation and Axios for API requests.
- Create components for various UI elements, such as book listings, rental forms, and user authentication.
- Implement containers to handle the logic of communicating with the backend through API requests.
- Set up routing using React Router to navigate between different pages.
- Add CSS or a CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap or Material-UI) for styling.

### Test and debug the application:
- Test individual components and API endpoints using tools like Postman for the backend and Jest for the frontend.
- Use browser developer tools to debug frontend issues and Spring Boot logs to identify backend problems.

### Deploy the application:
- Build the frontend and backend into production-ready artifacts.
- Deploy the backend to a server, such as AWS EC2, Heroku, or DigitalOcean. Set up and configure the database server as needed.
- Deploy the frontend to a static hosting service, like Netlify, Vercel, or an S3 bucket.
